### Grokking the Object-Oriented Design.

The process of OO analysis and design can be described as:
1. Identifying the objects of a system.
2. Defining relationships between objects.
3. Establish an interface of each object.
4. Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages.

We need a standard method/tool to document all this information - we use UML.

UML diagrams are a representation of object-oriented concepts only.

## UML DIAGRAM - Unified Modeling Language.
There are 14 kinds of UML Diagram. It is organized in 2 distinct groups -
**Structural Diagram** -  structure of a system or process.
**Behavioral or Interaction Diagrams** - behavior of the
system, its actors, and its building components.

### Structural UML diagrams

- **Class diagram** - Describe structure and behavior in the use cases. This diagram provides a conceptual model of the system in terms of entities and their relationships
- Object diagram.
- Package diagram.
- Component diagram.
- Composite structure diagram.
- Deployment diagram.
- Profile Diagram

### Behavioral UML diagrams

- **Use case diagram** - Describe a set of user scenarios. It
  illustrates the functionality provided by the system.
- **Activity diagram** - Used to model the functional flow of control between two or more class objects.
- **Sequence diagram** - Sequence diagrams describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time.
- State diagram.
- Communication diagram.
- Interaction overview diagram.
- Timing diagram.
