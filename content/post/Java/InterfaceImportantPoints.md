Interface is used to hide the internal implementation of the feature and only shows the main functionality.

Both interface and abstract class are used for abstraction.

- All the data members by default in interface are public static final. We cannot define private or protected for the data member in interface.
- We donot create object of the Interface using the new keyword. We create a reference of the Interface and it is the object of the implemented class.
- An interface can extend another interface. An interface cannot implement another interface.
- We can define class inside an interface. We can add enum (class) inside the interface.
- We cannot put final method inside the interface. Then we will not able to override the method in the implemented class. 
- While overriding the method in the class we cannot change the visibility of the method. They are by default public.

### Difference between Interface and Abstract Class.
Example of Interface.
```java
interface I {
    int i=10; // They are public static final. We will not able to change the value assigned to the variable(final).
    // Many class will be implementing the interface there will be conflict in the value.
    void display(); // They are public abstract.
    // Public access from all the classes. Abstract not implementing the method.
}
public class InterfaceExample implements I{
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("The display method is updated.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        I a = new InterfaceExample(); //Reference type variable for the interface. Instantiate with the interface implemented class.
        System.out.println("Interface");
        //a.i=20; // This will give error we cannot modify the value.
        System.out.println(a.i);
    }
}
```
Example of the Abstract Class.
```java
abstract class AbstractClass{
    protected int i=0; // There can be any type of access modifiers in the abstract class.
    static final int f1=10;// Method can be static and can be non static.
    abstract void show(); // We can have both abstract method and concrete method. The abstract keyword should be used.
    void display(){
        System.out.println("Non abstract method.");
    }
}

public class AbstractClassExample extends AbstractClass{
    // Class can not extend more than one abstract class. Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java.
    // Class can implement more than one interface.
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is the show method of the abstract class.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractClass a = new AbstractClassExample();
        a.show();
        a.display();
        a.i = 20; // We can change the value.
        //a.f1=20; // It is final.
        System.out.println(a.i);
    }
}
```
### When to use Interface and Abstract Class?
Interface - We donot know the implementation logic of the method. We know the requirement clarification then we use the Interface.

Abstract Class - We know the implemnetation logic of few class and not all. Then we create the abstract class.

### Why a class can not extend multiple class but an interface can extend multiple interface?
Java does not allow multiple inheritance. An interface is a pure abstraction model so it does not have any inheritance hierarchy like class.

### Uses of interface in Java.
- An interface is used to achieve fully abstraction.
- Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
- Programmers use interface to customize features of software differently for different objects.
- By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

### What is a Marker Interface in Java?
An interface that does not have any data members and methods is called Marker Interface.
Example - Serializable, Clonable, Remote etc.

### Nested Interface.
Interface inside an interface. By default it is static in nature. It is also called static interface.
```java
interface outerInterface{
    void method1();
    interface innerInterface{
        void method2();
    }
}
class MyClass implements outerInterface, outerInterface.innerInterface {
    @Override
    public void method1() {
        System.out.println("Method 1.");
    }

    @Override
    public void method2() {
        System.out.println("Method 2.");
    }
}

public class I1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass oI = new MyClass();
        oI.method1();
        oI.method2();
    }
}

```
