### RAM.
- Stores data temporarily while your computer is running. 
- It's fast and flexible, juggling all the  programs we're running at any given moment.
- RAM is volatile, meaning it loses  its stored data when the power is turned off.
### ROM.
- Retains data even when the power is off. 
- It's non-volatile and used to  store essential information, like firmware and the BIOS, that  your computer needs to boot up.

### Different types of RAM

**SRAM or Static Random Access Memory** - Fast and expensive type of RAM used in high-speed applications like CPU  caches, where quick access time is crucial.

**DRAM or Dynamic Random Access Memory** - Slower and cheaper than SRAM. It needs to be constantly refreshed to  retain data, making it more high-maintenance.

There are many types of DRAM, including **FPM DRAM**, **EDO DRAM**, **SDRAM**, and **DDR SDRAM**  with each generation bringing faster  speeds and increased efficiency.

Many are obsolete, and the common types of **DRAM**  
in the market today are DDR  variants, like **DDR4**, **DDR5**.

**GDDR** - It is a specialized type of DRAM optimized for faster data transfer rate, which the GPU needs for its  massive parallel processing.

**GDDR6** is the most widely used today.

### Essential  roles of ROM: Firmware and BIOS!
**Firmware** - Type of software stored in ROM that  
controls how hardware devices  communicate with each other.

**BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System** - The first  software your computer runs when you power it up.

It's responsible for starting your  computer, initializing hardware components, and handing control over to the operating system.

### Hard Disk  Drives and Solid State Drives.

**Hard Disk Drives or HDDs.**

They store data on spinning  magnetic disks and are known  
for their large storage capacities at a low price.

**Solid State Drives or SSDs.**

It uses NAND-based flash  memory, providing faster data access, reduced power consumption, and increased durability  compared to HDDs, but come at a higher price.

### NVMe or Non-Volatile Memory Express.

A high-performance interface for SSDs that connects directly to the  CPU via PCIe lanes. 

This allows for lower latency and significantly faster data  transfer rates compared to SATA-based SSDs.

### Flash Drives and SD Cards!

**Flash Drives** or **USB drives** or **thumb  drives** - Small, plug-and-play devices you can use with any USB port. They're easy to use and  perfect for transferring files between computers.

**SD Cards** - Commonly found in cameras and smartphones. They can store thousands of files. SD cards come in three main physical  sizes: SD, microSD, and miniSD.
